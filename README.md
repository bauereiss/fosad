Foundations of Security Analysis and Design in Isabelle
=======================================================

This repository contains formalizations of some of the theories presented in
the lecture "Grundlagen der Sicherheitsanalyse und des Designs" for the
interactive theorem prover [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

Currently, it contains formalizations of

* noninterference à la Goguen-Meseguer, and
* reference monitors à la Rushby.

Formalizations of some of the other parts of the lecture are available
elsewhere. For example, the Volpano-Smith security type system can be found
[here](http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/VolpanoSmith.shtml) in the [Archive
of Formal Proofs](http://afp.sourceforge.net/index.shtml).
